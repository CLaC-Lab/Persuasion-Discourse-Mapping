# Note: DR Parsing Process

This directory contains the results of parsing the PT-annotated dataset with discourse relations.

## Parsing Process
- We used our **top 9 classifier models** to annotate the `PT_dataset_A.json` dataset with discourse relations
- The parsing results include some hallucinations that were then processed manually

## Hallucination Handling
**Hallucination definition**: This includes:
- non-PDTB senses
- "no relation" responses
- level-1 senses

**Important**: Level-3 sense predictions were **not** considered hallucinations as they were mapped to their level-2 parent sense. Note that macro-F1 scores do not include hallucinations in their calculation, as these can easily be filtered out.

## Manual Processing
- For hallucinations, we manually added "NA" to the `DR` key
- For valid level-3 predictions (not considered hallucinations), we manually added their corresponding level-2 parent sense
- After hallucination removal, we copied the cleaned JSON files and placed them in the `02_hallucination_removed/` directory

## Directory Structure
- `01_with_hallucination/`: Contains the raw parsing results before hallucination processing
- `02_hallucination_removed/`: Contains the dataset after manual hallucination processing and correction
- `03_pooled_datasets/`: Contains the final pooled datasets created from multiple classifiers
