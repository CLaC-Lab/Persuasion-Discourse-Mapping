# IMPORTANT NOTE: Persuasion Techniques Dataset Processing

## Automated Preprocessing (main preprocessing script)
* Started with **SemEval 2023 Task 3** dataset
  * **3,760 human-annotated news/web paragraphs** (some with multiple PTs)
* **Flattened** multi-labeled instances 
  * Increased from **3,760 → 5,853 instances**

## Additional Manual Processing (performed separately)
These steps were performed using separate local scripts and are not part of the main preprocessing pipeline:

* **Balancing** by reducing overrepresented categories 
  * Reduced top 2 PTs from **48% → 30%** of instances
  * Resulted in **4,315** instances
  
* **Sentence Filtering** - removed paragraphs with **>2 sentences**
  * Ensures more reliable DR annotation, prevents multiple competing DRs
  
* **Final PT dataset** after all processing: **2,064 instances** with **19 PTs** available in this dataset (`PT_dataset_A.json`)
